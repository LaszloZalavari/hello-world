# hello-world

Hi!

My name is Laszlo. I am a theoretical particle physicist with a PhD from McMaster University. I have graduated not long ago and in my pursuit of a career in Data Science I am currently learning how to code in Python properly. I have some scientific computing experience but I would like to know how to develop software the right way and apply that knowledge in medical and renewable energy settings.

I am just starting out so bear with me!

Laszlo
